      <Title>Checklist: LinkedIn strategy</Title>
      <Text>
        Are you interested in using LinkedIn for business? For your convenience,
        we have prepared a laundry list of things that can and should be done.
      </Text>
      <SubTitle>
        #1 Create and fill in your Company Page or Showcase Page
      </SubTitle>
      <Text>
        Your LinkedIn Company Page is the heart of your business, serving many
        different purposes that reflect different aspects of your brand. On your
        Company Page, you can share your company’s story, post news and updates,
        and promote job opportunities. The LinkedIn Showcase Page, which acts
        like a “child” of and is a product of the LinkedIn Company Page, allows
        you to create an audience around your branch, product, or any other
        topic.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <span>You might want to start from a company page, then.</span>
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Provide as much information as possible for your Company Page profile,
        including a description, website, products and services, employees,
        industry, and contact information. Media (such as images and videos) can
        also be added to your page to give potential customers a better
        understanding of what you do.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        If you are in charge of LinkedIn management at a company that you have
        just joined, chances are that such a page already exists. It is
        therefore best to check there first before creating a new one.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        If this is the case, you’ll want to claim the page as yours and add your
        own employee profile. Sometimes, it is necessary to rework the company
        page completely to make it effective and complete.
      </Text>
      <SubTitle>#2 Share it internally</SubTitle>
      <Text>
        Once you have your profile up and running, share it with your employees.
        They should be the first ones to follow the page, write recommendations,
        and engage with the content.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Make sure everyone knows that LinkedIn is now a part of your marketing
        strategy so they can help contribute and make the most of it. If you
        emphasize how important it is for your company, employees will be more
        likely to take it seriously.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        In this step, you can even consider creating a short set of slides or
        guidelines that outlines what you want your employees to do on LinkedIn.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <span>These may include:</span>
      </Text>
      <List>
        <TextList>
          your content schedule – so they know when posts go live
        </TextList>
        <TextList>reactions, comments, and hashtags to use</TextList>
        <TextList>a set of captions to leverage in their own posts</TextList>
        <TextList>other miscellaneous do’s and don’ts</TextList>
      </List>
      <SubTitle>
        #3 Work on your communication lines for your LinkedIn page
      </SubTitle>
      <Text>
        Creating a LinkedIn strategy starts with strong communication. You need
        to have a clear idea of what you want to achieve and how you’re going to
        get there.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        If you’re not sure where to start, it might be helpful to look at some
        of the most successful LinkedIn pages. What do they have in common? How
        are they using the platform to reach their target audience? Once you
        have your strategy in place, it’s important to work on your
        communication lines.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        This means ensuring that your page is updated regularly with fresh
        content and that you’re responding to any comments or queries in a
        timely manner. It also means using LinkedIn’s various features to their
        full potential – from sharing articles and blog posts to taking part in
        groups and discussions.
      </Text>
      <SubTitle>#4 Check what type of content you can publish</SubTitle>
      <Text>
        LinkedIn is a great platform for publishing all sorts of content, from
        blog posts and articles to infographics and videos. You can post a few
        forms there:
      </Text>
      <List>
        <Item>
          <Img src={post} alt="Add posts" />
          <ul>
            <li>photos</li>
          </ul>
        </Item>
        <Item>
          <Img src={ogilvy} alt="Ogilvy posts" />
          <ul>
            <li>videos</li>
          </ul>
        </Item>
        <Item>
          <Img src={lidl} alt="Lidl posts" />
          <ul>
            <li>
              link posts – often used to share important company updates in the
              form of either internal or external press release
            </li>
          </ul>
        </Item>
        <Item>
          <Img src={binance} alt="Binance posts" />
          <ul>
            <li>
              documents (e.g. PDFs) – one of the most interactive forms of
              content on LinkedIn, allowing for scrolling through PDFs directly
            </li>
          </ul>
        </Item>
        <Item>
          <Img src={offended} alt="Ofended posts" />
          <ul>
            <li>polls – you can run a quick survey to get feedback</li>
            <li>
              occasions – you can celebrate events using this special format
            </li>
            <li>
              hiring announcements – you can post a LinkedIn Job offer for free
            </li>
          </ul>
        </Item>
        <Item>
          <Img src={job} alt="Jobs posts" width={1034} />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Text>events</Text>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </Item>
      </List>
      <Text>
        Regardless of the form you choose, make sure your content reflects your
        brand values. You may want to use some LinkedIn marketing tools to
        streamline content creation too.
      </Text>
      <SubTitle>#5 Set up a few series of hashtags</SubTitle>
      <Text>
        When it comes to LinkedIn strategy, hashtags are your friend. They help
        you to target your audience more effectively and also make it easier for
        people to find your content.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        In order to best utilize LinkedIn hashtags, set up a few series of
        hashtags that you can use in each post. This makes it easy to keep track
        of which hashtags are performing well, and it also means you don’t have
        to spend time coming up with new ones every time you publish something.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Once you’ve set up your hashtags, be sure to include them in all of your
        posts. You can also include them in your profile so that people will
        know which topics you’re interested in, and your business will be
        consistent. This applies especially to brand hashtags that are very much
        yours, and yours only.
      </Text>
      <SubTitle>#6 Consider creating a content calendar</SubTitle>
      <Text>
        A social media content calendar is a great way to keep track of all the
        content you publish on LinkedIn. Having one helps you plan ahead and
        also makes it easier to see which types of content are performing well.
        Without such a plan, it could be difficult –if not impossible – to
        oversee your LinkedIn strategy.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        There are lots of different ways to create a content calendar, such as
        using:
      </Text>
      <List>
        <TextList>customized templates</TextList>
        <TextList>spreadsheets</TextList>
        <TextList>project management tools</TextList>
        <TextList>social media management tools</TextList>
      </List>
      <Text>
        Once you have a content calendar in place, be sure to stick to it. This
        will help you stay on track and ensure that your page is always
        up-to-date.
      </Text>
      <SubTitle>#7 Think about using LinkedIn Groups and LinkedIn ads</SubTitle>
      <Text>
        You are not limited to using a Company Page only – Groups on LinkedIn
        are a great way to connect with potential customers and reach out to new
        audiences. LinkedIn Groups make it easy to network with like-minded
        professionals and make a great source of leads. Now is the time to start
        using them if you aren’t already.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        It’s also possible to run LinkedIn ads, which are an excellent way to
        better target your audience. Advertisers can choose who sees their
        campaigns, what type of content they want to promote, and how much money
        to spend. This makes them ideal for targeting specific demographics, as
        well as for promoting a brand.

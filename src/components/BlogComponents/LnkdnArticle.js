      <Title>Before you start with your LinkedIn strategy</Title>
      <Text>
        We know that you would probably like to start with your LinkedIn
        strategy straight away. However, before you begin sharing content and
        engaging with your audience, there are a few things you should do.
      </Text>
      <SubTitle>Identify your goals</SubTitle>
      <Text>
        What do you want to <TxtAccent>achieve</TxtAccent> with LinkedIn? Do you
        want to generate leads, build thought leadership, or improve your
        employer brand?
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Depending on your goals and<TxtAccent> social media KPIs</TxtAccent>,
        you may have to create different types of content and focus on different
        features of LinkedIn. For example, if you want to:
      </Text>
      <ul>
        <TextList>
          generate leads – focus on creating interesting and interactive content
        </TextList>
        <TextList>
          build thought leadership – share valuable content that will help you
          establish yourself as an expert in your field
        </TextList>
        <TextList>
          improve your employer brand – post job openings and connect with
          potential employees
        </TextList>
      </ul>
      <Text>
        Identifying your goals and creating a plan to achieve them will help you
        to get the most out of LinkedIn for business.
      </Text>
      <SubTitle>Verify your target audience</SubTitle>
      <Text>
        You need to know who you are speaking to. With LinkedIn, you can browse
        and target people based on their job title, company size, or other
        factors. By using this information, you can reach the right people with
        your content.
      </Text>
      <Text>In this step, you should ask yourself: </Text>
      <ul>
        <TextList>Who is my target audience? </TextList>
        <TextList>What are their needs and pain points? </TextList>
        <TextList>How can I help them with my content?</TextList>
        <TextList>
          If you don’t know the answer to these questions, you won’t be able to
          create social media content strategy that resonates with your target
          audience. So take some time to get to know yours before you start
          using LinkedIn for business.
        </TextList>
      </ul>
      <SubTitle>Set up responsibilities</SubTitle>
      <Text>
        It is important that you establish and share responsibilities in
        advance. This refers to the range of tasks you assign to your team
        members.
      </Text>
      <Text>Make sure you’ve assigned the tasks below:</Text>
      <ul>
        <TextList>
          <TxtAccent>creating and publishing content</TxtAccent>
        </TextList>
        <TextList>approving content with clients/stakeholders</TextList>
        <TextList>reviewing content</TextList>
        <TextList>managing the profile</TextList>
        <TextList>responding to comments</TextList>
        <TextList>reporting</TextList>
      </ul>
      <Text>
        Things can quickly become chaotic if you lack a clear understanding of
        who is responsible for what. You should determine tasks and make
        everyone aware of them.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <TxtAccent>
          Sounds like a lot? In Resonate, you can oversee almost all of these
          things under one roof.
        </TxtAccent>
      </Text>
      <SubTitle>Check how your competitors are doing</SubTitle>
      <Text>
        Competitive analysis can provide you with some unique insights you won’t
        find anywhere else. Pick 3-4 of your main competitors, visit their
        LinkedIn profiles, and see what kind of content they are publishing. You
        may spot some patterns or simply get inspired by well-performing
        strategies.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        But don’t just copy your competitors. You want to be different and stand
        out from the crowd, so take the time to create content that is unique
        and relevant to your target audience.
      </Text>
      <Text>You should analyze:</Text>
      <ul>
        <TextList>what types of content works best for them</TextList>
        <TextList>how often they post updates</TextList>
        <TextList>how (and if) they reply to comments</TextList>
        <TextList>how many followers they have</TextList>
        <TextList>how engagement looks on their profiles</TextList>
      </ul>
      <Text>
        and anything else that comes to your mind. It may also be a good idea to
        take note of anything extraordinary they do in their profiles.
      </Text>
      <SubTitle>Rethink your resources</SubTitle>
      <Text>
        Lastly, determine if you actually have the resources to manage and
        promote your LinkedIn profile. There’s more to a LinkedIn strategy than
        simply posting content and hoping for leads to come in. In order to
        promote your profile effectively, you need a plan and the resources to
        put it in place.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        It takes time and effort to create and maintain a LinkedIn profile. You
        might be better off focusing on another channel if you do not have the
        resources to devote some time to LinkedIn.
